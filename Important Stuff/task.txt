The component has the following functionlities:

* The timer value decreases by 1 every second. For example,if the initial value is 100,after 1 second it becomes 99, after 1 more second it becomes 98, and so on.

* The timer value starts decreasing right after the component is mounted.

* The initial value of the timer is set by a prop 'initial' passed down to the component.

*Once the counter value becomes 0, it should not decrease further.

* The button 'Stop Timer" stops the timer at the current value was 120, and the button is passed at 110, the timer stops at value 110.

The following data-test-id attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:

* The timer value should have the data-test-id attribute 'timer-value'.

* The 'Stop Timer' button should have data-test-id attribuye 'stop-button'.

Please note that the component hass the above data-test-id attributes for test cases and certain classes and ids for rendering purposes. They should not be changed.

The component must have the following functionalities:

The input should initially be empty.

If no value is entered, clicking on the 'Add Customer' button should not do anything.

If a value is present, clicking on the 'Add Customer' button should add the input value to the list below. For this, add <li>{input}</li> to the <ul data-test-id="customer-list"> element.

After adding the value to the list, clear the value of the input box.

Please note that the customer list <ul> element should only be rendered if it has at least one customer added (i.e., at least one <li> child). So initially, when the app is mounted, the <ul> element should not be rendered since no customers have been added.

All the values added by the button should be rendered in the list below.

 

The following data-test-id attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:

The input should have the data-test-id attribute 'app-input'.

The button should have the data-test-id attribute 'submit-button'.

The customer list <ul> should have the data-test-id attribute 'customer-list'.

Elements in the list should have the data-test-id attribute as 'list-item0', 'list-item1', 'list-item2', 'list-item3', and so on.

 

Please note that the component has the above data-test-id attributes for test cases and certain classes and ids for rendering purposes. It is advised not to change them.
