-----------------Dependency injection-----------------

* its an important application design pattern.

* Angular has its own DI framework,which is typically
used in the design of Angular application to increase
their effiviency and modularity.

--------------------Angular Services------------------

* Services allows us to create reusable common shared
functionality between various modules and components

* Services are singleton which means they have only
single instance 
* Services are injected into application using 
dependency injection mechanism 
* we need to create and inject services in components
where we want to use them
* Services are an abstraction layer or process layer 
which consists of our application business logic
* Services are commonly used for making HTTP request to
our endpoints APIs to request and receive the response
* A services can have value,methods or a combination of
both
--Service uses--->
  Imported the service into the component->
  ->Create an instance in the constructor ->
  ->call the method using the instance of the service
  then bind
-----------HttpClient---> HyperText Transfer Protocol
-> Standard HTTP Methods
 -> Http Methods
*get()->get means we are requesting the resours from 
the api 
*post() thats means we are trying to send the data
*put() that means we are trying to update an existing
resource
*delete() a resource by sending that information to the
api
*head() we can use which are cofigured as http methods
when we send the data to the back end

---------Benefits of HttpClient--------
1. HttpClient includes Observable APIs
2. HttpClient can have the HTTP Headers in options
