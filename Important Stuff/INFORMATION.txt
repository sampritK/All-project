 formGroup
  * Each elements is a formControl
  * when one or more formcontrol are grouped together 
we call it formgroup.
FormBuilder
  - its an obstraction layer which makes it easy to
  design and built our form.
 *formBuilder has three things that-
  -formGroup - we can't use individually
  -formArray - 
  -formControl- we can't use it separatly
     - FormBuilder-> break down your form into smaller
    pieces of code
     -> which is reusable / simple to maintain

---------Reactive form-set form Value--------

I failed to understand the value of time during 
my early 
days of college life and now I feel upset about.

Because you found a better match.

This job interview is about matching what your company needs,
 and what I want. Currently I'm very interested by the
 opportunities you have to offer and I think we would
 work very well together. If your company finds a 
better match and you decide to hire them, 
well I wish both of you the best of luck. 
I hope to meet again in future endeavours.
