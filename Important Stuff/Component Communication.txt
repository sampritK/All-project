--------------Component Communication--------------

2. How do you use Angular component
     -> Can we pass custom selector name? -> Yes of course
     -> Use the select tag as directive
3. How do you use Angular component from different module?
     -> Users Module
       -> component -> list-users
     - Import the custome/newly created module into App Module
     - Export the respective components that we want to
       use outside of the module

4. Angular components communication   
   -> @Input and @output directive
   -> Using services 

5. 1 Input 
     ->  parent -> sending data to child 
   2 Outputs
     -> child -> parent
  -> we need to pass data from parent using [variableName]
  -> Same needs to be defined in the child component as @Input

how many ways we can share data between two components-
-> 1. parent-child 
-> 2. child - parents
-> 3. through service
-> 4. view child

*EventEmitter =>a component defines two output 
properties that create event emitters. 
When the title is clicked, the emitter emits an open or 
close event to toggle the current visibility state.
