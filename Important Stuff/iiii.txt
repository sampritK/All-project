So, what is the difference between authentication and authorization? Simply put, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to.

const apiKey = 'fzzEAqmVsALrgmYvNQ7brG4G9GCNAtNU';
const apiUrl = 'https://api.zebra.com/v2/data/devices/batteries/analytics/visibility/critical-battery-events';
      const headers = new HttpHeaders({
        'Authorization': `${apiKey}`
      });
      this.http.get(apiUrl, { headers }).subscribe(
        (data) => {
          this.response = data;
        },
        (error) => {
          console.error('Error:', error);
          this.response = 'Error occurred while fetching data
Take a look at it, no error is coming, yet the data is not visible.
